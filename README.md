Zorg (https://zorg.github.io/) is a Python framework for robotics and physical computing.

This module provides drivers for the [Emic2](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11711) text to speech module.
Typically, this library is registered by an adaptor class such as [`zorg-edison`](https://github.com/zorg/zorg-edison) that supports the needed interfaces for output devices such as this one.

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `pip install zorg-emic`
